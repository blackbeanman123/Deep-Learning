#General ideas about CNN architectur

## Depth

###Depth++ means:
1. non-linearty++ -> learing ability++
2. regularization++ but degradation++
3. convergence--


###conclusion:
1. The network shouldn't be too shallow, making it contain too many params(need large kernels) and lack non-linearty 
2. The network shouldn't be too deep, which is prone to vanishing/exploding gradients and degradation
3. CNN for simple dataset tend to be shallower than CNN for complex dataset.
